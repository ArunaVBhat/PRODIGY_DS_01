# PRODIGY_DS_01
This project visualizes the distribution of population across various age groups using Python and Matplotlib. It creates a bar chart that helps in understanding how populations are distributed based on age categories, which can be useful for demographic analysis or educational purposes. The script uses a simple dataset, but can easily be adapted to real-world data.

To run the program, you will need Python 3.x along with the pandas and matplotlib libraries, which can be installed via pip. After modifying the age group data in the script as needed, you can generate the visualization by executing the Python file.
